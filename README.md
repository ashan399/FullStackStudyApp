This application was created using Python Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
• Backend was handled using Flask and Python. GET requests queried a database to find and display specific posts while POST requests updated the database with new objects or modified an existing entry.
• Wrote front-end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Used template inheritance to minimize code and allow block overriding.
